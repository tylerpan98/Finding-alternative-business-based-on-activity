********AI Assistant for Finding Places That Fit Your Needs & Schedule********

****Overview****

Ever moved to a new place and struggled to find a good restaurant? Or tried to avoid crowded places but had no reliable way to check? That’s exactly the problem I faced. Over the past 10 years, I’ve lived in four different states and repeatedly found myself frustrated—searching for decent food, figuring out when places were packed, or simply finding alternatives that better suited my needs.

This project was born out of that frustration. I wanted an AI-powered assistant that doesn’t just suggest places to eat but helps find alternatives that match your priorities, schedule, and preferences—whether that’s avoiding crowds, prioritizing high-rated spots, or just finding something nearby.

But why stop at food? This system can be adapted and deployed for various businesses, including shopping, gyms, and even car services.


****Key Features****

Smart Recommendations: Find restaurants, cafes, stores, gyms, and more based on your location and needs.

Crowd Prediction: Uses AI (Markov Chains) to estimate future busyness levels, so you can plan ahead.

Personalized Priorities: Choose between highest-rated, least crowded, or closest locations.

Sentiment-Based Insights: Uses AI-driven sentiment analysis to analyze user reviews.

Scalable & Adaptable: Designed for broader applications beyond food, making it a powerful tool for various industries.


****How It Works****

Location-Based Search: Enter your zip code, and the AI fetches nearby businesses.

Crowd Analysis & Prediction: The system analyzes how busy a place is and predicts future crowd levels.

Personalized Recommendations: The AI recommends locations based on your priorities.

Alternative Suggestions: If a place is too crowded, the system suggests alternatives that better fit your needs.
